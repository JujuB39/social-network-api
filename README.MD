# Social Network API 

## Description 
This weeks challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. 

## Installation 
In order to use this the user should install Express, MongoDB and Moment. Also since this application does not run on the web the user should download insomnia to see the routes working. 

## Usage

To use this app the user needs to run node server.js. They can see all the routes working through insomnia once this is run.
